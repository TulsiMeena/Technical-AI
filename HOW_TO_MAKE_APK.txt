# How to Create APK (Android App) for Technical AI

Since I am an AI environment, I cannot directly compile a binary `.apk` file for you. However, I have prepared the **Source Code** so you can build it yourself in 2 minutes.

### Option 1: Use a Free Online Builder (Easiest)
1.  Download the `technical_ai_ready_for_apk.zip` file provided.
2.  Extract it. You will see `index.html`, `script.js`, `manifest.json`, and `mobile_build/config.xml`.
3.  Go to a website like **VoltBuilder** or **PhoneGap Build (Legacy)** or any "HTML to APK Converter".
4.  Upload the zip file.
5.  It will give you a `.apk` download link.

### Option 2: Use Cordova CLI (For Developers)
If you have Node.js installed on your PC:
1.  Install Cordova: `npm install -g cordova`
2.  Create a project: `cordova create technical_ai com.technical.ai "Technical AI"`
3.  Copy my `index.html`, `script.js`, and other files into the `www` folder of that project.
4.  Copy my `mobile_build/config.xml` to the root folder.
5.  Run: `cordova platform add android`
6.  Run: `cordova build android`
7.  Your APK will be ready in `platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

### What is included in this App?
-   **Full Screen Mode:** Status bar and navigation bar blended.
-   **Native Plugins Config:** Camera and Geolocation plugins are defined in `config.xml`.
-   **Icons:** Placeholder path for icons is set in config.

Enjoy your Ultra Advanced AI App!
